      <p>This is because of Hyder Ali, the ruler of Mysore, liked the cool climate of Bangalore and so planned a garden that was named as Lalbagh. Apart from this, its greenery was further improved during British rule. This abundance of greenery earned it the nickname, 'Garden City of India'.</p>
        <p>Most people fall in love with the city just because of its climate and it is one of the main reasons for people to migrate from other states to the city. The weather of Bengaluru has always been a key attraction for the people. The monsoons during June to November are the highest</p>
          <p>In addition, Bangalore being the Silicon Valley of India, there is a proliferation of tech parks which has, in turn, increased the demand for housing. Rent in Bangalore are so high as a result of a lack of newly built homes and rising housing demand</p>
